# DGM1600 Fall 2017 | Chicken Game | Calysto Chastain

Here is the game I completed during my time in the DGM1600 course offered by UVU. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I have enjoyed the opportunity I have been given to create it. There are a number of fun features to be found which are described in greater detail within the in-game tutorial. Catch those chickens before it's too late!

## To Run:

Navigate to the **builds/pc** folder of the downloaded .zip file or cloned repository, and run **chickengame_x86.exe**

### Scripts and other assets are located within the Chicken_Game folder.
