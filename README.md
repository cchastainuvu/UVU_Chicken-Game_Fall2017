# DGM1600 Fall 2017 | Chicken Game | Calysto Chastain

Here is the game I completed during my time in the DGM1600 course offered by UVU. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I have enjoyed the opportunity I have been given to create this game.

## To Run:

Navigate to the builds/pc folder of the downloaded .zip file or cloned repository, and run chickengame_x86.exe
